# Automated Least Squares Solution Finder Calculator

This project is a web-based calculator designed to compute the **least squares solution** of an overdetermined system of linear equations using concepts from **Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory**.

The application applies the **Normal Equation**  
AᵀA x̂ = Aᵀb  
to determine the best-fit linear model for a given set of data points. All matrix operations—including transpose, matrix multiplication, and matrix inversion—are implemented using JavaScript.

To enhance understanding, the project also provides:
- Step-by-step matrix computations
- Numerical and fractional result formatting
- Interactive visualization of data points and the best-fit line using **Three.js**

This project was developed as a **final requirement** for the course **Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory** at **Polytechnic University of the Philippines – Sta. Mesa**.
